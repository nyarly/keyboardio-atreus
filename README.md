# Kaliedoscope Atreus

This is a repo filtered from https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope
to contain only an Atreus configuration.

It can (and has) been set up analogously to
https://github.com/keyboardio/Model01-Firmware
so that it can be built from the command line,
and without tying into the main firmware.
